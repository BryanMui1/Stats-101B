## Q1)

### part a)

 Response, factors, blocks, held constant factors.
 
 Response: scores of students on reading comprehension
 
 Factors: reading modality(screen or paper)
 
 Blocks: Word reading and vocabulary, two different primary schools in Norway
 
 Held constant factors: grade(tenth), texts, type of text
 
I would also perform multiple tests in different age groups and also separate by gender, because result might vary due to age group and gender could be a good blocking factor to make sure the student population being tested is uniform

### part b)

There were 72 students in the study, I don't believe that this is large enough of a sample size, the power was 0.67, meaning that there is a high probability of not being able to properly identify to reject the null. I would increases samples to get power to at least 0.80

### part c)

The author is talking about the consistency of the questionnaire, saying that because of Cronbachâ€™s alpha is high at 0.75, then the questions used were consistently answered among all the participants


### part d)

```{r}
data1 <- read.csv("paper_vs_ereader.csv")
head(data1)
```

### part e)


## Question 2


### part a)

```{r}
baldness <- read.table("HeartDiseaseBaldness.txt", header=TRUE)
head(baldness)
```

### part b)

```{r}
dim(baldness)
```

### part c)

```{r}
colnames(baldness)
```

### part d)

H0: Early Baldness is uncorrelated with Heart Disease

HA: Early Baldness is correlated with Heart Disease

### part e)

```{r}
table(baldness$Heart_Disease, baldness$Baldness)
```

### part f)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(baldness, aes(x = Baldness)) + geom_bar()
ggplot(baldness, aes(x = Heart_Disease)) + geom_bar()
ggplot(baldness, aes(x = Baldness, fill = Heart_Disease)) + geom_bar()
```

### part g)

```{r}

```


## Q3)

### part a)

Social implications of wealth: Which factors predict one's income?

### part b)
